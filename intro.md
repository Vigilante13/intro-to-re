## Introduction
Reverse Engineering is an invaluable skill. Both hardware and software engineers use reverse engineering when debugging code or analyzing a foreign program they encountered with no source code available. The basic techinques of reverse engineering can be applied to any situation involving a simple piece of code.

When you write a program, you often don't think about how you wrote the program. You're given a task to code a specific functionality and you write that program in the style that you were taught or learnt. Reverse engineering makes you view your code in a more abstract manner. 

- If someone wrote a similar program, could you identify it by simply looking at the assembly or machine code? 
- If someone has a bug in their program, could you easily identify the issue? 
- Are there any system functions you could replace in your code that are more secure and don't have any vulnerabilities to avoid potential hacks? 

These are just a few examples that we ask ourselves about the code we write. Having a deeper understanding of code, beyond the surface-level functionality, is a critical technique in reverse engineering.
