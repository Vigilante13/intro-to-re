# Tools
In this section I'm going to cover various tools that software/hardware engineers use when attempting to reverse engineering a piece of code.

## Disassemblers 
A diassembler is a tool that breaks down a compiled program from any high or low-level programming language and turns it into machine code, or assembly.

### List of Disassemblers
- IDA
- Binary Ninja
- GNU Debugger (GDB)
