## Purpose of this site
The purpose of my document is to introduce people to the field of reverse engineering, provide some resources and tips for future job interviews and inform people about specific steps and processes they can follow if they want to approach a problem using reverse engineering.

If you already are familiar with Reverse Engineering, then I suggest skipping the [Introduction](https://vigilante13.github.io/intro-to-re/intro.html) Section and going immediately to the [Tools](https://vigilante13.github.io/intro-to-re/tools.html) section.

Otherwise, start with the "Introduction" section to familiarize yourself with the topic of Reverse Engineering
