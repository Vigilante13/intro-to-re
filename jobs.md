## Jobs/Interviews
Reverse Engineering has a lot of applications in the industry. Here is a list of common jobs and their relative sectors:

- Information Security
  - Malware Analysis
  - Static/Dynamic Analysis
- Software
  - Reversing x86, linux executables
  - Debugging/Bug testing
- Hardware
  - Reversing Embedded Systems
  - Logic Analyzers/Oscilloscopes
  - Circuit Debuggers/Emulators

If you are in a job interview, here are also some common question they may ask:
  - What tools do you use to assess a binary program?
  - How would go about detecting stack-based attacks in a program?
  - Do you have any experience with "X" disassembler?
  - Tell me about any relavant job experience.
  
Overall, reverse engineering is a very difficult field to start getting into. It requires a lot of knowledge of programming languages and Computer Architectures, included Embedded Systems.

You have to assess a program creatively and look to see how to document vulnerabilities in a function or attempt to understand program execution using the tools you have at your disposal.

## Books/CTFs

If you want to improve your reversing skills, I suggest reading books on Reversing:

* [Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming: 32-bit, 64-bit, SSE, and AVX](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-X86-Assembly-Language-Programming/dp/1484200659): Fundamentals of x86 assembly language programming. It focuses on the aspects of the x86 instruction set that are most relevant to application software development.
* [Practical Malware Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901): Practical Malware Analysis will teach you the tools and techniques used by professional analysts. With this book as your guide, you'll be able to safely analyze, debug, and disassemble any malicious software that comes your way.
* [Practical Reverse Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Reverse-Engineering-Reversing-Obfuscation/dp/1118787315): The book covers x86, x64, and ARM (the first book to cover all three); Windows kernel-mode code rootkits and drivers; virtual machine protection techniques; and much more. Best of all, it offers a systematic approach to the material, with plenty of hands-on exercises and real-world examples.
* [Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Secrets-Engineering-Eldad-Eilam/dp/0764574817): Beginning with a basic primer on reverse engineering-including computer internals, operating systems, and assembly language-and then discussing the various applications of reverse engineering, this book provides readers with practical, in-depth techniques for software reverse engineering.
* [Reverse Engineering for Beginners](https://beginners.re/): Available in english and russian, this ebook is a good introduction for beginners. Numerous topics are touched : Oracle RDBMS, Itanium, copy-protection dongles, LD_PRELOAD, stack overflow, ELF, win32 PE file format, x86-64, critical sections, syscalls, TLS, position-independent code (PIC), profile-guided optimization, C++ STL, OpenMP, win32 SEH.
* [The IDA Pro Book: The Unofficial Guide to the World's Most Popular Disassembler](https://www.amazon.com/IDA-Pro-Book-Unofficial-Disassembler/dp/1593272898): Hailed by the creator of IDA Pro as "profound, comprehensive, and accurate," the second edition of The IDA Pro Book covers everything from the very first steps to advanced automation techniques.

This field is still emerging, and in order to be on top you have to constantly refresh your memory on various programming languages, computer architechtures, and tools.
